# Million-Songs-Analysis-LDSA
### Data set
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data set being used is called 'Million Song Dataset', it contains meta data from around one million different songs, and has a total size of 300 GB.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stored using Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) which is a storage model for data with many dimensions and complex objects.
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data set does not store any actual audio but instead consists of song fea-
tures and meta-data collected and analyzed by The Echo Nest. Each HDF5 file stores information about one song.
